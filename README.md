# Mora Flora

**An app for plant enthusiasts, by a plant enthusiast.**

---

Mora Flora is an app for exchanging plants with people in your local area
(or as far as you're willing to travel!). Have you ever had a plant you were
struggling to take care of, didn't have anyone to give it to, but felt guilty
about allowing to die? Or, have you ever wanted a specific plant but didn't
know where you could find one? Mora Flora was made with these situations in
mind. Users can create posts either offering a plant of theirs to the
community or requesting a plant in hopes someone else has one to share. Other
users can then see those posts and connect with the poster by whichever means
were provided. When creating posts, users are prompted to select their location
on a map; users can then filter other users' posts based on proximity.

**See a demo of the app [here](https://mora-flora-demo.vercel.app/).**
